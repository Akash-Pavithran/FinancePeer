The app is built by keeping dark theme and light theme in mind. That is the convention i follow for easier maintanence in future if the client need to change the theme all of a sudden
For location, the latitude and longitude will be shown, and not the place name since no google maps api key were provided

The release variant of the app is taking too long to build, which is why i sent the code before it is too late.
